# Ecommerce-php-mysql
An ecommerce site
## Finally a whole project using PHP
Was a step up for me and well I didn't  design the UI.
## Main aim
- Design a functional  backend system
- Deliver dynamic content
- Dynamic routing
- Cart function
- A wishlist that works hand in hand with a cart
- Get total price for items in  cart
## What I used 
- PHP
- MYSQL
- Ajax
- SQL
I was able to get the content and loop over.
Do dynamic routing for one to view the product

As a whole a great project that I learnt how to manipulate
arrays and important  array functions.
PHP is a favourite till now
